train_covid19.py is done by Adrian Rosebrock 

Read me:
1-	Put all the code files in the same directory.
2-	First, you need to train the model by executing the train_covid19.py script
    With “python train.py --dataset dataset”
3-	After you execute it successfully (it will take some time) a new covid19.model should appear in the directory
4-	Flash the ParticleCode file to your particle device
5-	Open the GUI-code.py file and Replace your-device-ID-goes-here with your actual device ID and replace your-access-token-goes-here with your actual access token, in line 52 and 57.
6-	Transfer the GUI_code.py and the covid19.model file to your Raspberry Pi device
7-	Connect to your Raspberry Pi remotely and then execute the GUI_code.py
